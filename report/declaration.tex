\maketitle
This is the group declaration for team botbot.\\

For more details, please see our github project at https://github.com/Pilen/aimas/tree/merge\_branche.
Note that merge\_branche is more resent than the master branch.\\

Simon made the single agent level, and Søren did the multiagent level.\\

The overall architecture of our client, and strategy used to plan was discussed
and decided in common during our group meetings.\\

\section{Programming project}
The initial communication with the server was done by Simon, and later extended
by Søren to log the server response.\\

The logging part of the client, including a logging server was done by Søren.\\

The heap and heap test was done by Søren.\\

Parsing the level was done by Søren. \\

APSP and room/corridor detection was done by Simon.\\

Goal priorities are done by Søren.\\

We both worked on the tools file.\\

Simon created functions that would generate move, push or pull actions from a point
to another without actual searching. This was not used in the final project.\\

Due to communication faults we both implemented A*. Simon's version was kept, although
this was build upon some of Søren's code. This includes the code for generating
transitions.\\

The check to see if a new task has occurred or has finished was done by Simon.\\

Multiagent merging was done by Simon.\\

Storage tasks, storage calculation  and assigning of initial tasks where done by Simon.\\

The final results were performed by Søren.

\subsection{Heuristics}
totalDistance, taskDistance, goalCount, StorageTaskCount, storagePun, sameRoad, boxInCorridorPun
and the state modifier was done by Simon.\\

misconfiguration and badness was done by Søren.

\section{Report}
We have both contributed to the outline.\\
Søren wrote about goal priorites, the rest of the methods section was done by Simon.\\

Experiments mostly by Simon.\\

Søren wrote about testing in the discussion, the rest of the discussion was done by Simon.\\

Releated work, future work by Simon.\\

Conclusion mostly by Søren.
